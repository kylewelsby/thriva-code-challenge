# Thriva Frontend Code-challenge

## 2020-08-20 19:18:00

It has been a few days since receiving this code challenge and finding an ounce of time to attempt it. 

I've been moving this week and haven't found a spare moment, but I have found an hour to get the outline of the project started.

I have downloaded the designs from the invited Zeplin design share to `__DESIGNS__` for archival reference and maybe some Visual Image Testing via Cypress (no promises).  

As I have completed a few code challenges, I have developed a few processes that help boilerplate starting a new project for the assignments.

My base product will start with a Vite Vue.js project with Cypress.io installed and some Continuous integration setup.

I have finished the initial project setup with a few disruptions, committed to GitHub. 

Taking a break, and My next session, I'll be looking at getting the project look and feel wired up.

Going to be honest, I only seen the Zeplin designs for now with the assumption to implement the functionality of the designs from start to finish in the best of my understanding. 

It was not until just now where I relalised email invitation email had a codebase attachment until now containing a bunch of isolated challenges.  

Now I am abandoning this attempt and re-starting the code-challenge with the new found information
