# Thriva Frontend Code-challenge

## 2020-08-20 19:18:00

It has been a few days since receiving this code challenge and finding an ounce of time to attempt it. 

I've been moving this week and haven't found a spare moment, but I have found an hour to get the outline of the project started.

I have downloaded the designs from the invited Zeplin design share to `__DESIGNS__` for archival reference and maybe some Visual Image Testing via Cypress (no promises).  

As I have completed a few code challenges, I have developed a few processes that help boilerplate starting a new project for the assignments.

My base product will start with a Vite Vue.js project with Cypress.io installed and some Continuous integration setup.
