# Thriva Frontend Code-challenge

Firstly, thank you for Thriva for inviting me to complete this code challenge and share my skills.

It has been a few days since receiving this code challenge and finding an ounce of time to attempt it.

I've been moving over the past week and haven't found a spare moment.

I have downloaded the designs from the invited Zeplin design share to `__DESIGNS__` for archival reference and maybe some Visual Image Testing via Cypress (no promises).

I have re-worked [`README.md`](./README.md) to flow better and resemble what this project is for my Github archive.

Also, there's some initial setup code to utilise Github actions for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment to Github Pages.

As I have completed a few code challenges, I have developed a few processes that help boilerplate starting a new project for the assignments.
